# DiffrazioniFestival2016

A generative live performance created in Unity3D for the electronics trio composed by Maurizio Montini, Andrea Venturoli and Francesco Pellegrino 

Some OSC MaxMSP packets send to Unity the displacement parameters. 
By default OSC signal are enable. To disable put bOsc = false and play with the UI Editor.

Change OSC IP and Port in OSCReceiver.cs 

You can also use different mesh just changing the instance of mesh1 into the Editor, keep in mind has to be with same name "mesh1"

Have fun !
